## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the design, development, and implementation of **tEcoHabitat-One**, the first tEcoHabitat — a fully automated, self-sufficient, human-scale habitat designed to provide high-quality living while preserving nature and minimizing ecological impact.  

### 1.2 Scope  
tEcoHabitat-One will integrate advanced technologies in automation, renewable energy, water recycling, food production, and waste management to create a **closed-loop community** of approximately 150 people. The habitat is designed to be **scalable** and **replicable**, eventually forming a network of sustainable communities worldwide.
